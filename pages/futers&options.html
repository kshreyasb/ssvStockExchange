    <h1>Futures and Options Overview</h1>

    <p>Welcome to our comprehensive overview of futures and options in the financial markets. These derivatives play crucial roles in risk management and speculative trading.</p>

    <h2>Futures Contracts:</h2>
    <p>A futures contract is a standardized agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date, known as the expiration date, for a price agreed upon today.</p>
    <p>The buyer is obligated to purchase, and the seller is obligated to sell, the asset at the agreed-upon price on the specified future date.</p>
    <p>Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges, providing liquidity and transparency. They are widely used for hedging against price fluctuations or for speculative purposes.</p>

    <h2>Options Contracts:</h2>
    <p>An options contract gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a specific asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a specified time period.</p>
    <p>The buyer pays a premium to the seller for this right.</p>
    <p>The seller (or writer) of the option is obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract if the buyer decides to exercise the option. Options are versatile and traded both on organized exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC).</p>

    <h2>Additional Information:</h2>

    <h3>Implied Volatility and Greeks:</h3>
    <p>Options pricing is influenced by factors such as implied volatility and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega). Traders often analyze these metrics to make informed decisions about their options strategies.</p>

    <h3>Margin Requirements and Leverage:</h3>
    <p>Futures contracts typically involve margin requirements, which traders must maintain to cover potential losses. Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital, but it also increases risk.</p>

    <h3>Marking to Market and Settlement:</h3>
    <p>Futures contracts undergo daily marking to market, adjusting margin accounts based on the daily settlement price. Settlement can occur through physical delivery or cash settlement.</p>

    <h3>Options as Risk Management Tools:</h3>
    <p>Options are not only used for speculation but also as risk management tools. Investors can employ options to protect their portfolios against adverse market movements.</p>

    <h2>Key Differences:</h2>

    <h3>Obligation:</h3>
    <p>In a futures contract, both parties are obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract.</p>
    <p>In an options contract, only the seller (writer) is obligated if the buyer decides to exercise the option.</p>

    <h3>Risk and Reward:</h3>
    <p>Futures involve unlimited profit potential and loss potential.</p>
    <p>Options involve limited risk (the premium paid) and unlimited profit potential.</p>

    <h3>Flexibility:</h3>
    <p>Futures contracts are more rigid, with standardized terms.</p>
    <p>Options offer more flexibility, allowing investors to create various strategies to suit their risk tolerance and market expectations.</p>
